# [StarfallEx](https://github.com/thegrb93/StarfallEx) support for [sumneko's Lua language server](https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server) extension

I want to give credit to [Derpius](https://github.com/Derpius/nanosworld-vscode) as most of this extension's code is reused from his.

Provides stubs of StarfallEx's API to the sumneko Lua language extension.  
All stubs are generated automatically from [Potato's Emmyfall project](https://github.com/yogwoggf/emmyfall)
